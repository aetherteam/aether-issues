##The Aether II Issue Tracker
This is the issue tracker for the the Minecraft mod, the Aether II.

This issue tracker isn't meant for bugs or other problems on our Aether Official Server.

### A step-by-step guide to creating issues
- Verify that nobody else has already posted the same issue. You can use GitHub's search bar to find similar issues using keywords.

- Give your issue a concise title. The title shouldn't contain the whole issue, but rather a very brief description of the issue, such as "the Altar crashes the game when enchanting berries".

- Now describe your issue in detail. Please provide _specific instructions_ (videos and screenshots are allowed, as long as they are clear) on how to reproduce your issue.

- If your issue is a crash, **you must upload** your `fml-client-latest.log`, along with any other relevant crash or log files to [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com) (or any other text-uploading service, such as Pastebin) and attach the URL to your issue.
  
- Add anything else you find relevant or useful for developers/maintainers to know.

- Be brave and hit that Submit button!
